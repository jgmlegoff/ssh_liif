Liif implementation for SSH implicit arbitrary-scale super-resolution.  

This code is mostly based on the LIIF project ([project page](https://yinboc.github.io/liif/)) and its [implementation](https://github.com/yinboc/liif).   

Changes has been made to adapt the code to the task of SSH super resolution using the [RESAC-SARGAS60 dataset](https://data.ipsl.fr/catalog/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c3c33afe-2a37-42e1-bb29-21428387f658) available.  

This work has been conducted in the scope of a master thesis internship in the teams from La Sorbonne : MLIA and LOCEAN. The master thesis that resulted from this work is available [here](https://github.com/jgmlegoff/ssh-downscaling).
