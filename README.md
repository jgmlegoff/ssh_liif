Liif implementation for SSH implicit arbitrary-scale super-resolution.  

This code is mostly based on the LIIF implementation available [here]{https://github.com/yinboc/liif}.   

Changes has been made to adapt the code to the task of SSH super resolution using the RESAC-SARGAS60 dataset available [here]{https://data.ipsl.fr/catalog/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c3c33afe-2a37-42e1-bb29-21428387f658}.  

This work has been conducted in the scope of a master thesis internship in the teams from La Sorbonne : MLIA and LOCEAN. The master thesis that resulted from this work is available [here]{https://github.com/jgmlegoff/ssh-downscaling}

The initial project is Learning Continuous Image Representation with Local Implicit Image Function, and its page is available [here]{https://yinboc.github.io/liif/}
